Introduction
------------

This is a simple JIT compiler for Java built on top of JamVM.


How can I try it out
--------------------

You need git to download jamvm-sources. To compile jit-jamvm and run the
unit tests, follow these instructions:

  1. Download jit-jamvm sources the first time:
  
    % git clone http://www.laughingpanda.org/~penberg/pub/scm/jit-jamvm.git jit-jamvm

  2. Compile monoburg

    % cd jit-jamvm/monoburg/
    % make

  3. Compile jit-jamvm and run unit tests:

    % cd jit-jamvm/
    % ./configure
    % cd jit/
    % make

- Bytecode to IR conversion
	* INVOKESPECIAL
	* INVOKESTATIC
	* Converting whole compilation unit
	* GETSTATIC type parsing
	* Replace STMT_NULLCHECK and STMT_ARRAYCHECK with STMT_IF and STMT_THROW
	* Basic block successors and precedessors
	* bytecode_size() for TABLESWITCH and LOOKUPSWITCH
	* Bytecode sequences where expression stack is non-empty in
	  basic-block boundary (e.g. the 'x ? y : z' expression).
- Instruction selection
	* Remove dependency to glib
- Register allocation
	* Linear scan register allocator [Poletto99]
- JIT code execution
	* alloc_exec() allocates complete pages which is wasteful. Intel
	  optimization guide recommends 16-byte alignment for branch targets
	  so make alloc_exec() return smaller memory blocks.
	* Patch call instruction in the caller to avoid redundant JIT
	  trampoline calls after target method has been compiled.
